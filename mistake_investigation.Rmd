I have tried with including  " ```  ", it appears like that: 

```

$$P(E|L) = \frac{P(L|E) * P(E)}{P(L)} = \frac{0.3 * 0.5}{0.3 * 0.5 + 0.5*1} = 0.23$$


```
then only with " $$ " and it appears like that :

"$$P(E|L) = \frac{P(L|E) * P(E)}{P(L)} = \frac{0.3 * 0.5}{0.3 * 0.5 + 0.5*1} = 0.23$$"

Also only with " $ " and it appears like that :

$P(E|L) = \frac{P(L|E) * P(E)}{P(L)} = \frac{0.3 * 0.5}{0.3 * 0.5 + 0.5*1} = 0.23$
